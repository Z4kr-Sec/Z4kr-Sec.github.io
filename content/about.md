## Ricardo Morales Solorzano. 

Hello, I'm Z4kr, a passionate computer enthusiast with a lifelong curiosity about how computers work. From an early age, I’ve been fascinated by the intricacies of technology, which eventually led me to the world of cybersecurity. Around 4 years ago, I began my journey into hacking through the Hack The Box platform, and since then, I’ve been fortunate to explore a vast range of topics within the field of cybersecurity.

During my university days, I participated in multiple Google coding contests, which further solidified my passion for problem-solving and programming. Over time, I expanded my skills through platforms like PortSwigger.net, Hack The Box Academy, and VulnLab.

I am an ethical hacker with a deep interest in penetration testing and red teaming. The goal of this page is to create a space where I can share my knowledge, insights, and techniques in this incredible world of cybersecurity. The primary focus will be on write-ups for retired Hack The Box machines, my personal projects, and proof-of-concept demonstrations.
